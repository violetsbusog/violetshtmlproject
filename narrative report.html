		<h1>⇒ How I did my HTML Project ⇐</h1>

		<h1>Making this html project mostly consisted of researching and gathering information for each subject topic, then copy pasting most of the codes for html in notepad. I also made and edited majority of the pictures used in my html. The different websites like w3schools.com, and YouTube videos also helped me a lot and made it a bit easier. But, coding is still really difficult for me personally because if example, something goes wrong; in the flood of texts and codes, I'd have to find the code or text thats causing the problem, or repeat all over again. Knowing this also made me unmotivated at times to code or do the project which made it delay even more.
<br>		
		But there's also the positive points which is that through the process of making this project, I was able to learn so much more information on each of the subjects because of all the research, examples, and videos I've found. I was also able to develop more of my problem solving, creativity, logic, and thinking skills because of coding. So, as you can see, doing this integrated project wasn't all that easy and I did have a lot of difficulties in the making process.
<br>		
		However, I'm still so glad I was able to finally finish because Im able to feel accomplished and I'm and happy that i have less work and can rest, and I was also able to learn so much, not only for school, but also important life lessons as well !</h1>
