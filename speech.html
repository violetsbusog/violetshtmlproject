<font align="left" size="2" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1><b>✩ Why is learning about the parts of speech important ?</b></h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ Parts of speech are important because they function as the building blocks for grammar. 
<br>
		↳ They show us how different words relate to each other, but also, as soon as we assign each word a role, and put them into a sentence, we actually get something a lot more meaningful.
<br> 		
		↳ We would know the role and function that each word has in a sentence structure clearly because it helps us to understand sentences, have the ability to construct them properly, and overall improve in our grammar, comprehension and writing skills.
