		<h1>✩ What are Graphs ?</h1>
<font align="center" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1><b>↳ Graphs are pictorial representations that are designed to express words, represents data, or values in an organized manner. They show the relationship between two numbers or measurements through a series of one or more points, lines, line segments, curves, or areas.</b></h1>
<hr>
	<font align="left" size="2" face="CHICKEN Pie">
		<h1>✩ Why are Graphs important ?</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ They show relationships between data and are intended to display and make complex or large amounts of information into easy to remember and easy-to-understand formats that clearly and effectively communicate important points that would be easier to remember.</h1>
<hr>
<font align="left" size="2" face="CHICKEN Pie">
		<h1>✩ There are different kinds of graphs which are :</h1>

<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>• Line Graph</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ Also called line plot or a line chart, this graph shows you how numbers have changed over time. 
<br>
		↳ They are used to show how 2 quantities (variables) are related or how they vary with each other.
<br>
                ↳ Line graphs are plotted using several points connected by straight lines.
<br>
	  	↳ It comprises of two axes known as ‘x’ axis and ‘y’ axis.

		<h1>• Bar Graph</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ It is used to show numbers that are independent of each other.
<br>
              ↳ It is one of the most commonly used graph to present information and compare groups of data visually.</h1>

<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>• Histogram</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ It is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights and the height of each bar shows how many fall into each range.
<br>
                ↳ It is constructed to represent the information on a frequency table.
<br>
	    	↳ It consists of several vertical bars with no space between bars that are next to each other.
<br>
	    	↳ It is the most commonly used graph to show frequency distributions.
<br>
    		↳ It is similar to a Bar Chart, but a histogram groups numbers into ranges.</h1>

		<h1>• Pie Graph</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ - It is a type of graph that displays data in a circular graph.
<br>
		↳ It shows you how a whole is divided into different parts, and each part represents a particulr category/item.
<br>
	 	↳ The pieces of the graph are proportional to the fraction of the whole in each category. In other words, each slice of the pie is relative to the size of that category in the group as a whole. 
<br>
		↳ The entire “pie” represents 100 percent of a whole, while the pie 'slices' or 'wedges' represent portions of the whole.
<br>	  	 
		↳ The central angle for each sector corresponds to the amount of each piece of data it represents.</h1>

		<h1>• Pictogram</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ It is a special type of bar graph but instead of using an axis with numbers, it uses pictures to show data.
<br>
	     	↳ They  are eye-catching hence are commonly used in newspapers and magazines which is why one advantage of using them is that the visual presentation can be made attractive and easy to understand.
<br>
	     	↳ A disadvntage is that they lack detailed informtion since it only uses pictures or symbols.</h1>

		<h1>• Linear Graph</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ It has the form : <u>y = f(x) = a + bx</u>
		↳ It is a straight line or straight graph which is drawn on a plane connecting the points on x and y coordinates.
	        ↳ It is also a linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. <u>The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.</u></br></h1>

<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>• Quadratic Graph</h1>
<font align="left" size="1" face="Lucida Fax">
		<h1>↳ It is a curve called a <i>"parabola"</i>, which a curved shape opening up or down. It intersects its axis of symmetry (a vertical line that divides the parabola into two congruent halves) at a point called the vertex which is th ehighest point of the parabola.
		     ↳ form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are numbers with a not equal to zero.</h1>
